                    Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle. In prehistoric times, humans hunted aurochs and later domesticated them.
                    Since then, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred specifically for the quality or quantity of their meat.
                    Today, beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, after pork and poultry
